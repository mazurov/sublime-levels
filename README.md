## Supported languages

* **JavaScript:** Uses [JsLint](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSLint) and V8 Python binding  &mdash; [PyV8](https://github.com/emmetio/pyv8-binaries)

## How to install

**WARNING:** this plugin may not work at all in some OSes since it written in JavaScript and uses PyV8 and Google V8 binaries to run.



* Clone or download git repo into your packages folder (In SublimeText ```Preferences->Browse Packages...``` menu item to open this folder):
   - Clone: ```git clone https://github.com/mazurov/sublime-levels.git Levels```
   - Download: https://github.com/mazurov/sublime-levels/archive/master.zip and extract sublime-levels-master to the packages folder.

or

* Use Package Control:
    * Preferences
    * Package Control
    * Add Repository
    * Insert the repository Url (should be `git://github.com/mazurov/sublime-levels.git`)
    * Then install it normally via Package Control by doing `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` -> `Install Package` -> `sublime-levels`


**WARNING:** When plugin is installed, it will automatically download required PyV8 binary so you have to wait a bit (see Loading PyV8 binary message on status bar). If you experience issues with automatic PyV8 loader, try to install it manually.

## Available commands

* Enable scope context coloring: __Levels: Update__ ```Ctrl+Shift+L```
* Restore original coloring: __Levels: Off__ ```Ctrl+Shift+O```

* The **live** coloring mode  is not switched on by default (the current plugin version works slow for large scripts). You can enable it in settings  by```"live": true```.
* The code is automatically colored after a save action.




## Theme customization

By default the plugin use a modified version of the default theme ```Solarized (Light)```. If you want to use your favorite theme, you need to add new scope coloring rules like in plugin's ```Levels-light.hidden-tmTheme```:

```xml
    <dict>
            <key>name</key>
            <string>Level0</string>
            <key>scope</key>
            <string>level0</string>
            <key>settings</key>
            <dict>
                <key>foreground</key>
                <string>#FDF6E3</string>
            </dict>
        </dict>
    ...
        <dict>
            <key>name</key>
            <string>Level9</string>
            <key>scope</key>
            <string>level9</string>
            <key>settings</key>
            <dict>
                <key>foreground</key>
                <string>#cf9369</string>
            </dict>
        </dict>
```

, and update ```color_scheme``` value in plugin settings (applied only for
scope coloring mode) or in default user settings.


## Known issues.

### JsLint

JsLint, which is used here for JavaScript coloring, is not an ideal tool for
JavaScript parsing. It doesn't support modern standard features (for example
"var" keyword in for cycle), so scope coloring could fail on some scripts.

If you would like to be sure  that your coloring problem is in JsLint and not in
this plugin you can check your code on [this page](http://daniellmb.github.io/JavaScript-Scope-Context-Coloring/example/scope-coloring.html#fullmonad). If you have the same problems there then it means that the problem
is in JsLint (or in your code)

## Thanks

Thanks to [Sergey Chikuyonok](https://github.com/sergeche) for the nice
idea of using PyV8.
